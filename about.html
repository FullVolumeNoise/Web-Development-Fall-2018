    <h1> Meet the Artist</h1>
    <p> Alexandria Eddings is a junior at Jones College Preparatory High School. She specializes in visual art.
      Her preferred mediums are pencils, markers, ink and digital art programs.
      She has yet to debut at an public events, but has made various artworks across different mediums.
      Her artwork tends to draw from the imagination rather than being based off of a specific theme.
      She mostly draws based off of what she finds aesthetically pleasing rather than meaning.
	  She's mostly self-taught, but has taken art classes to refine her skills.
	  She enjoys psychological horror shows and movies over graphic ones. She enjoys animation, but not modern American cartoons.
	  She is currently working on 3D modeling with Blender.
		Her favorite color is white, but she likes to wear black, red, purple, and blue. She generally values comfort over fashion,
		but if the occasion calls for it, she will dress elegantly.
		<br>
		<br>She has been drawing ever since she was a child. Inspired by cartoons like Winx Club, she began drawing the characters she
		saw on TV. Eventually, this evolved to drawing her own original characters and short comics in her notebooks. From there, she kept practicing, drawing and doodling things
  daily. At some point along the way, she decided to try and practice digital art in MS Paint using only a mouse.
  In 2014, she got her first Wacom Intuos tablet. It drastically improved her digital art and she was finally able to replicate the beautiful techniques that she saw her artistic
  rolemodels doing. Later, she began streaming her drawing and taking requests for art on Deviantart.</p>
